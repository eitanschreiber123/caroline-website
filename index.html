        <div class="caroline"></div>
        <p>I am a lifelong learner who has had a vast experience in the business world.
           I have been lucky to co-own a business for over 10 years and worked in the financial, educational and, transportation sectors.
           At the present time, I have started a new journey in coding, because I see it as the new wave of the future.
           I am a recent graduate from New York Coding + Design Academy on a scholarship from NYC Tech Talent Pipeline in Web Development.
           I am so excited about this journey because I always wanted to be in this field and now I am.
           I am open to new opportunities. So donâ€™t be afraid to send a note.</p>
